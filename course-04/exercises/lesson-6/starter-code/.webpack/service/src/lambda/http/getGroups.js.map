Since the microtask queue is not\n * exposed externally, promises need to be modified in a fairly invasive and\n * complex way.\n *\n * The async boundary in promises that must be patched is between the\n * fulfillment of the promise and the execution of any callback that is waiting\n * for that fulfillment to happen. This means that we need to trigger a create\n * when resolve or reject is called and trigger before, after and error handlers\n * around the callback execution. There may be multiple callbacks for each\n * fulfilled promise, so handlers will behave similar to setInterval where\n * there may be multiple before after and error calls for each create call.\n *\n * async-listener monkeypatching has one basic entry point: `wrapCallback`.\n * `wrapCallback` should be called when create should be triggered and be\n * passed a function to wrap, which will execute the body of the async work.\n * The resolve and reject calls can be modified fairly easily to call\n * `wrapCallback`, but at the time of resolve and reject all the work to be done\n * on fulfillment may not be defined, since a call to then, chain or fetch can\n * be made even after the promise has been fulfilled. To get around this, we\n * create a placeholder function which will call a function passed into it,\n * since the call to the main work is being made from within the wrapped\n * function, async-listener will work correctly.\n *\n * There is another complication with monkeypatching Promises. Calls to then,\n * chain and catch each create new Promises that are fulfilled internally in\n * different ways depending on the return value of the callback. When the\n * callback return a Promise, the new Promise is resolved asynchronously after\n * the returned Promise has been also been resolved. When something other than\n * a promise is resolved the resolve call for the new Promise is put in the\n * microtask queue and asynchronously resolved.\n *\n * Then must be wrapped so that its returned promise has a wrapper that can be\n * used to invoke further continuations. This wrapper cannot be created until\n * after the callback has run, since the callback may return either a promise\n * or another value. Fortunately we already have a wrapper function around the\n * callback we can use (the wrapper created by resolve or reject).\n *\n * By adding an additional argument to this wrapper, we can pass in the\n * returned promise so it can have its own wrapper appended. the wrapper\n * function can the call the callback, and take action based on the return\n * value. If a promise is returned, the new Promise can proxy the returned\n * Promise's wrapper (this wrapper may not exist yet, but will by the time the\n * wrapper needs to be invoked). Otherwise, a new wrapper can be create the\n * same way as in resolve and reject. Since this wrapper is created\n * synchronously within another wrapper, it will properly appear as a\n * continuation from within the callback.\n */\n\nif (instrumentPromise) {\n

The SDK does not manage refreshing of the token value,\n * but this can be done through a \"refresh token\" supported by most identity\n * providers. Consult the documentation for the identity provider for refreshing\n * tokens. Once the refreshed token is acquired, you should make sure to update\n * this new token in the credentials object's {params} property. The following\n * code will update the WebIdentityToken, assuming you have retrieved an updated\n * token from the identity provider:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials.params.Logins['graph.facebook.com'] = updatedToken;\n * ```\n *\n * Future calls to `credentials.refresh()` will now use the new token.\n *\n * @!attribute params\n *   @return [map] the map of params passed to\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId},\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}, and\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}. To update the token, set the\n *     `params.WebIdentityToken` property.\n * @!attribute data\n *   @return [map] the raw data response from the call to\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity}, or\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}. Use this if you want to get\n *     access to other properties from the response.\n * @!attribute identityId\n *   @return [String] the Cognito ID returned by the last call to\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}. This ID represents the actual\n *     final resolved identity ID from Amazon Cognito.\n */\nAWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * @api private\n   */\n  localStorageKey: {\n    id: 'aws.cognito.identity-id.',\n    providers: 'aws.cognito.identity-providers.'\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Creates a new credentials object.\n   * @example Creating a new credentials object\n   *   AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({\n   *\n   *     // either IdentityPoolId or IdentityId is required\n   *     // See the IdentityPoolId param for AWS.CognitoIdentity.getID (linked below)\n   *     // See the IdentityId param for AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity\n   *     // or AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken (linked below)\n   *     IdentityPoolId: 'us-east-1:1699ebc0-7900-4099-b910-2df94f52a030',\n   *     IdentityId: 'us-east-1:128d0a74-c82f-4553-916d-90053e4a8b0f'\n   *\n   *     // optional, only necessary when the identity pool is not configured\n   *     // to use IAM roles in the Amazon Cognito Console\n   *     // See the RoleArn param for AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity (linked below)\n   *     RoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/MYAPP-CognitoIdentity',\n   *\n   *     // optional tokens, used for authenticated login\n   *     // See the Logins param for AWS.CognitoIdentity.getID (linked below)\n   *     Logins: {\n   *       'graph.facebook.com': 'FBTOKEN',\n   *       'www.amazon.com': 'AMAZONTOKEN',\n   *       'accounts.google.com': 'GOOGLETOKEN',\n   *       'api.twitter.com': 'TWITTERTOKEN',\n   *       'www.digits.com': 'DIGITSTOKEN'\n   *     },\n   *\n   *     // optional name, defaults to web-identity\n   *     // See the RoleSessionName param for AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity (linked below)\n   *     RoleSessionName: 'web',\n   *\n   *     // optional, only necessary when application runs in a browser\n   *     // and multiple users are signed in at once, used for caching\n   *     LoginId: 'example@gmail.com'\n   *\n   *   }, {\n   *      // optionally provide configuration to apply to the underlying service clients\n   *      // if configuration is not provided, then configuration will be pulled from AWS.config\n   *\n   *      // region should match the region your identity pool is located in\n   *      region: 'us-east-1',\n   *\n   *      // specify timeout options\n   *      httpOptions: {\n   *        timeout: 100\n   *      }\n   *   });\n   * @see AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId\n   * @see AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity\n   * @see AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n   * @see AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken\n   * @see AWS.Config\n   * @note If a region is not provided in the global AWS.config, or\n   *   specified in the `clientConfig` to the CognitoIdentityCredentials\n   *   constructor, you may encounter a 'Missing credentials in config' error\n   *   when calling making a service call.\n   */\n  constructor: function CognitoIdentityCredentials(params, clientConfig) {\n    AWS.Credentials.call(this);\n    this.expired = true;\n    this.params = params;\n    this.data = null;\n    this._identityId = null;\n    this._clientConfig = AWS.util.copy(clientConfig || {});\n    this.loadCachedId();\n    var self = this;\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'identityId', {\n      get: function() {\n        self.loadCachedId();\n        return self._identityId || self.params.IdentityId;\n      },\n      set: function(identityId) {\n        self._identityId = identityId;\n      }\n    });\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Refreshes credentials using {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity},\n   * or {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}.\n   *\n   * @callback callback function(err)\n   *   Called when the STS service responds (or fails).

Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(error, response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.
